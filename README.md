# PokemonWebApp
I am making my own pokemon web application because I felt that many pokemon sites, while they do have good features, were missing features from other pokemon sites. In order to have all useful features for pokemon, you had to have multiple different sites open at the same time and switch between them constantly. This web application will combine all of those useful features into one site. The app will include a pokedex which will provide a user with data from the game, a team builder to quickly build a pokemon team, and a damage calculator to assist a user with pokemon battles.  

This is in the early development stage. I am currently working on setting up a back-end web API with a database.
