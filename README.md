# PokemonWebApp
This website will present data from the video game, Pokemon, to the user and assist the user in certain gameplay features. It will include a pokedex which will display information about pokemon, types, moves, items, abilities, and egg groups. It will also have team builder, to quickly build a pokemon team, and a damage calculator to assist a user with pokemon battles. Other features may be added in the future depending on the progress being made.  

## Current Progress  
This is in the early development stage. The web API server is in a functional state and can be used. Improvments, and new features will be looked at a later time. Bugs will still be fixed when found. The client website is in current development.
